# Sprint Logs Archive

This folder contains detailed sprint logs and technical implementation notes.

## Purpose

The main [`PROGRESS_REPORT.md`](../PROGRESS_REPORT.md) provides a high-level overview suitable for students and stakeholders. This `sprints/` folder contains **detailed technical logs** for developers who need:

- Complete implementation workflows
- Code snippets and examples
- Debugging processes
- API integration step-by-step guides
- Error resolution details

## Available Sprint Logs

Sprint logs from the original progress report have been preserved here for reference. These contain:

- **Detailed code examples** (full implementations)
- **API response structures** (complete JSON examples)
- **Step-by-step integration workflows**
- **Bug fix processes** (root cause analysis)
- **Test results and console logs**

## How to Use

### For Students
You typically won't need these files. Stick to the main progress report for project overview.

### For Technical Team (Tiko)
Use these files when you need to:
- Understand how a specific feature was implemented
- Debug issues related to past sprints
- Reference code patterns used in the project
- Review API integration workflows

## Structure

Sprint logs are organized chronologically by date:

```
sprints/
├── README.md (this file)
├── 2025-11-11-ui-ux-sprint.md (if needed)
├── 2025-11-21-articles-api-sprint.md (if needed)
├── 2025-11-25-personalization-sprint.md (if needed)
├── 2025-11-26-for-you-feed-sprint.md (if needed)
├── 2025-11-27-backend-integration-sprint.md (if needed)
├── 2025-12-02-article-content-sprint.md (if needed)
└── 2025-12-03-bug-fixes-sprint.md (if needed)
```

## Note

Sprint logs are archived for reference but are **not actively maintained**. For current project status, always refer to the main [`PROGRESS_REPORT.md`](../PROGRESS_REPORT.md).
